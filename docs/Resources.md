## Challenge Official Resources:

[GES DISC OPeNDAP server (Hyrax)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/information/tools?title=OPeNDAP%20and%20GDS): The Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP) server provides access to many different data variables and provides an interface for data acquisition and subsetting.

[Giovanni](https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/): Giovanni provides access to multiple datasets and variables, and provides output in data maps and time-series.

[Data Rods for Hydrology](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/information/tools?title=Hydrology%20Data%20Rods): Data Rods for Hydrology provides several different hydrological variables and will display time series for a specific location.

[Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/): Worldview provides imagery and data links for numerous variables of interest.

[Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search): Earthdata search provides an interface to search for and access data from all NASA Earth science data centers. The data can be filtered by keywords, processing level, data formats etc.

[Data access Tutorials](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/information/howto?page=1&dataTools=Python): These tutorials provide step-by-step instructions on how to find, request, download, and open data files from NASA data center archives. These tutorials are provided in Jupyter Notebooks, which can be directly downloaded from the page or opened in the GitHub environment.

[Center for Weather Forecast and Climate Studies (CPTEC) at the Brazilian National Institute for Space Exploration (INPE)](https://satelite.cptec.inpe.br/home/index.jsp): The Center for Weather Forecast and Climate Studies (CPTEC) provides high-resolution weather forecasts, climate monitoring, and environmental modeling for Brazil and South America. Using advanced numerical models and satellite data, CPTEC generates short to long-term forecasts, severe weather alerts, and climate trend analyses. Its platform offers public access to dynamic maps, time series, and predictive simulations, supporting sectors such as agriculture, civil defense, and energy planning. All information is continuously updated and available through interactive tools for data exploration and visualization.
